# Website Clone - SmartMag

ðŸ”— **Live Demo**:([Live Demo](https://phakhawat-ck.github.io/phakhawat.github.io/Project%20Clone%20Web/Smartmag/))

## Overview
This project is a clone of the website [SmartMag](https://smartmag-pbt.blogspot.com/?m=1). The purpose of this project is to practice layout design skills and learn how to create a responsive website.

## Description
In this project, I focused on replicating the layout and functionality of the SmartMag website. It is intended purely for practicing layout techniques and responsive design, using HTML and CSS only.

## Contributions
I wrote 95% of the code myself. For the remaining 5%, I used AI to assist in solving certain problems and refining the code.

## Challenges and Learning
There are many mistakes and challenges throughout this project as I am still learning and improving my web development skills. I plan to continue learning and refining my techniques for writing cleaner and more efficient code.

## Future Improvements
I intend to revisit this project to correct errors and improve my layout and responsiveness skills. This will help me to better understand web design and development principles.
